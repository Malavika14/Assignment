Hello! My name is M.Malavika, and I’m a passionate and eager-to-learn front-end developer. I recently graduated with a degree in Bachelor's of Engineering from Annna University(PERI Institute of Technology), where I focused on web development and design.

During my studies, I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve also worked with frameworks like React and Vue.js. I’ve built several projects, including a personal portfolio website and a few small applications, which helped me develop a strong understanding of responsive design, user experience, and front-end best practices.

I’m particularly excited about creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces and am constantly exploring new technologies to improve my skills. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to apply my knowledge in a professional setting and contribute to a dynamic team.

Thank you for considering me for this role. I’m eager to bring my enthusiasm and fresh perspective to your team!
